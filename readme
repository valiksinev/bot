Make a trading bot that should enter a position of X amount specified in USD on
Binance Spot and Binance USD-M Futures. The bot should place a limit buy
order on the spot market and a market sell order on the futures for the
executed amount. The limit order price should be equal to the best bid on the
spot, and the limit order size should be equal to the best bid on the futures.

For example,
Order1: LIMIT BUY 1 BTCUSDT
Order1: PARTIALLY FILLED 0.2 BTC
Order2: MARKET SELL 0.2 BTCUSDT_PERP
Order1: FILLED 0.8 BTC
Order3: MARKET SELL 0.8 BTCUSDT_PERP
Order4: LIMIT BUY 1 BTCUSDT
... and so on

Predefined parameters:
Spot symbol: BTCUSDT
Perp futures symbol: BTCUSDT
Max order size: $100
Min order size: $25

Input:
X amount

Output:
execution reports (simple stdout is ok)
amount executed and spread on completion (difference between buy
and sell prices in bps)
